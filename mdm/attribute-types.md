  Choosing the right attribute type is essential when defining attributes in a
  Product Information Management (PIM) system. We use different types â€” such as
  text, integer, digital asset, URL or picklist

\

\
**Digital Asset:** Use this option when setting attributes for images.\
\
<mark style="background-color:yellow;">The Digital Asset data type can also be a Multi Digital Asset</mark>\ <mark style="background-color:yellow;">This attribute gets used when users want to quickly assign multiple assets to a single attribute, without necessarily needing to designate them as a specific angle or image type (e.g. "Top Image", "Side Image", etc.). We've seen clients use them for lifestyle images pretty often, where those images just need to be associated with a product in no particular order.</mark>\
\ <mark style="background-color:yellow;">These values get stored as an array in Catsy, and are exported as such. So output typically looks like this: image\_1.jpg|image\_2.jpg|image3.jpg</mark>\
\ <mark style="background-color:yellow;">You'll get the value for each image in the array separated by a pipe character.</mark>\
\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (541).png>)\
\
**Product Association:** Use this option when you want to relate one product to another while keeping them as separate products.\
\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (542).png>)\
\
**Date:** A date attribute field with calendar popup to select dates in a YYYY/MM/DD format\
\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (543).png>)\
\
**Readiness**: Build your own completeness score to see a visual of where you have gaps in your data\
