# Channel Management

Channels give the ability to configure exports for channel partners to meet their import requirements. These can be a .CSV format, .XLS format, or a .JSON format. Once the channel has been created and configured, exports are a simple process to get them in the desired format.

There are two ways to create a channel, one from an already existing template, and another by creating a new template from Attributes contained within Catsy.

Note: Remember that when you are installing an Excel type channel with a prepared template, if your template has a Validation Row, then the values that Catsy will detect are only "Required" or "Optional". If the Validation Level is indicated by using "Y" , "N", "Yes" or "No" then the validation level won't be detected properly and the validation level won't be noted correctly on the Channel's Attribute Mapping page\
