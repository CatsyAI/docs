Catsy channels are broken into three categories: <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (102).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Class B Channels <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (103).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Class A Channels and <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (104).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Direct Sync Channels. The class B channels are the least sophisticated and Direct channels are the most sophisticated. Please check the descriptions and differences between these channels below:

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (107).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Class B Channels These are Excel, CSV or XML channels that do not have Excel Macros. These are channels with straight forward data export rules where each row is an SKU, with one header line in either csv, or excel formats.

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (106).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Class A Channels These are Excel channels that have either (i) embedded excel macros or (ii) special formatting rules such as read only columns, or validation buttons, or conditionally required attributes.

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (105).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Direct Sync Channels These are channels that we directly integrate to such as Amazon, Walmart Marketplace, Shopify, BigCommerce, etc.\
