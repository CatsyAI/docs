# Amazon

Amazon templates vary depending on the category. Each template layout consists of different required and additional (but optional) fields. You can download category-based templates from seller central and observe the required fields for that specific category.&#x20;

Here are the steps you need to follow:

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (904).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Login to your seller central account and click on _Inventory > Add Products via Upload_

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (905).png" alt="" data-size="line"> Select the category you are trying to list on Amazon, select the marketplace you are selling and click 'Generate' at the bottom of the page.

With this, you find the required-additional fields and accepted variation theme for the selected category as well as their valid values for the related fields.
