* on product create

* when a product is deleted

* task: a task represents an individual step or stage in a workflow, such as Update, Review, or Revise. It can be assigned to a specific user and it can result in a specific action - e.g. Approve or Reject
* fork: a fork allows you to split a workflow into two or more branches, each branch representing a possible path that the workflow can follow
* join: unites multiple execution paths into one transition
* condition: this workflow step requires a specific condition to be met before the process can continue to the next element
* webhook: an external facing element that can invoke an interface external to Catsy through http
* email: lets you send an e-mail to the owner of a specific task in the workflow
