# Importing Data

Getting started with **Catsy** means leaving behind the frustration of disorganized spreadsheets and scattered product data. We know that your first import might feel like a big step—after all, clean, structured data is the foundation of a great PIM and DAM system. But don’t worry, **Catsy is built to make this process simple and efficient**.

Unlike traditional spreadsheet management, Catsy helps you **validate, standardize, and enrich your data** as you bring it into the system. Whether you’re consolidating from multiple sources or updating existing product information, you have the tools to ensure accuracy from the start.

To make your first import seamless, our **Customer Success team** has outlined a few best practices on **how to prepare your data and avoid common pitfalls**. Let’s get your products into Catsy the right way—so you can spend less time fixing errors and more time optimizing your catalog.

### **What Data Should You Prepare for Your First Import?**

To ensure a smooth and efficient onboarding process in **Catsy**, it’s important to structure your data correctly before importing. Here’s the best approach to get started:

#### [**1️⃣ Define Your Categories**](../mdm/categorization.md)

Setting up **product categories** in **Catsy** helps you organize and manage your catalog efficiently by grouping products based on shared attributes. Categories allow you to structure your data from broad classifications down to more specific product groupings, ensuring a well-organized system that simplifies navigation and data management.

In **Catsy**, when you assign a product to a category, it automatically inherits the relevant **attributes** for that category. This ensures that each product only contains the necessary fields, making data entry more intuitive and reducing clutter.

By defining your categories before importing products, you create a **structured, scalable foundation** for your catalog, ensuring that every product is categorized correctly and assigned the appropriate attributes.

#### [2️⃣ **Define Attribute Groups**](../mdm/attribute-groups.md)

Before importing your data into **Catsy**, it’s important to organize your attributes into logical groups. This makes it easier to manage product information, ensuring consistency and scalability.

By default, **Catsy provides four core attribute groups**:

* **Core Attributes** – Essential product details such as **Product Name, SKU, Brand, and Description**.
* **Digital Assets** – Links to images, PDFs, videos, and other media associated with each product.
* **Marketing** – Customer-facing content like **Keywords, Meta Descriptions, Features & Benefits**.
* **Specifications** – Technical details that define the product, such as **Material, Power Output, Voltage, or Fabric Type**.

You can also create **custom attribute groups** to fit your business needs. These can be structured in different ways depending on how you want to organize your product data. For example:

&#x20;**Function-Based Groups** – Organize attributes by function, such as:

* **Pricing & Selling Info** (MSRP, Wholesale Price, MAP Pricing)
* **Logistics** (Weight, Dimensions, Case Pack Quantity)
* **Compliance & Safety** (Certifications, Regulatory Warnings, Warranty Information)

**Product-Specific Groups** – Group attributes based on product types, ensuring that each category has relevant data fields. For example:

* **Nail Guns** – Attributes like PSI Rating, Magazine Capacity, Fastener Type
* **Pliers** – Attributes like Grip Material, Jaw Size, Cutting Edge Hardness

By structuring attribute groups to match your business needs, you can create a **more intuitive and scalable system**, ensuring that each product only contains the attributes relevant to it.

Setting up attribute groups first ensures that your **product data is well-structured and easy to manage**, helping you streamline imports and maintain clean, accurate information.

#### [3️⃣ **Import Your Defined Attributes**](../mdm/create-attributes.md)

Before bringing in any product data, you first need to establish the **attributes** that will structure your product information. Attributes define key details about your products, such as:

* Product Name
* Description
* Brand
* Dimensions (Height, Width, Depth)
* Weight
* Materials
* Categories
* Any other specifications relevant to your catalog

By setting up attributes, you create a solid framework that ensures all product data is properly mapped upon import.

#### [4️⃣ **Import Your Product Data (SKUs & Attribute Values)**](../pim/import-products/)

Once attributes are defined, the next step is to **import your product data**. This includes:

* **SKUs** – Each product must have a unique SKU to be properly identified.
* **Attribute Values** – Ensure that each SKU has the correct details for the category it is in.
* **Variants** – If applicable, products with multiple variations (e.g., size, color) should be structured properly.

This import ensures that all of your product information is correctly assigned, avoiding inconsistencies and duplicate entries.

#### [**5️⃣ Import and Link Your Assets (Images, PDFs, Videos, etc.)**](../dam/import.md)

Once your products are in the system, it’s time to **import assets** to enhance your product listings. You have two options for this:

* **Separate Asset Import** – Upload assets independently and link them to SKUs manually or via batch updates.
* **Include Asset URLs in the Product Import** – If your assets are already hosted online, you can **include direct links in your product import file** to automatically upload them to Catsy and map them to the correct SKUs.

By following this step-by-step approach, you’ll ensure your **data is structured correctly from the start**, minimizing errors and making future updates seamless. **Next, let’s walk through how to format your import files for a successful upload!**&#x20;
